# Interactive Application
The interactive application is programmed with the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/). This library is ideal because it has a full set of drawing functionality.

To use the library, simply add it to your ```HTML``` code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.10.2/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.10.2/addons/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```
