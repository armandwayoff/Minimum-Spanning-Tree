# Minimum Spanning Tree

This project was inspired by the video [9.9: Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm) - p5.js Tutorial](https://youtu.be/BxabnKrOjT0) made by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman).

The interactive application is programmed with the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/). This library is ideal because it has a full set of drawing functionality.
